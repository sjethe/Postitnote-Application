# Postitnote-Application
This is spring mvc application with CRUD operations.

Project can be downloaded via github. It is using maven, can be build with maven commands and run main class or with Jar file.

This is using spring boot and hibernate framework. I have used H2 in memory database to persist data and thymeleaf tempalate engine for view.

This application would have following options,

	1) View list of notes
	2) Add new notes
	3) Update existing notes
	4) delete note

Application can be accessed via http://localhost:8080/postitnote/V1/

You can add new notes by clicking on Add Note button, edit/delete with edit/delete button present in front of each record.
